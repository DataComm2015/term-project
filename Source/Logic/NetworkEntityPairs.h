/**

 * this file also contains message types exchanged between each of the defined
 *   pairs. this is used for multiplexing of messages for each of the

 *
 * A {NetworkEntity} on the server is logically linked to a {NetworkEntity} on
 *   the client, but these {NetworkEntity} instances usually are not instances
 *   of the same class, because they need to behave differently since one is on
 *   the server side, and the other is client side.

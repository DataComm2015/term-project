to start writing programs using google test:

    google google test, and download gtest 1.7.0
    extract resultant zip, doesn't matter where

    navigate the terminal until you are in the gtest-1.7.0 folder
        ^ the main parent folder

    execute the following commands:
        ./configure
        make
        cp -a include/gtest /usr/include
        cp -a lib/.libs/* /usr/lib/

this is a check:
    ldconfig -v | grep gtest

output of valid check:
    lgbtest.so.0 -> libgtest.so.0.0.0
    lgbtest_main.so.0 -> libgtest_main.so.0.0.0


when writing code:
    #include "gtest/gtest.h"
        ^yes quotes, and yes gtest/

when compiling, these are needed:
    -lgtest -pthread


"yum install gtest" may or may not be needed, didn't have time to check

I'll probably write a script to do all this

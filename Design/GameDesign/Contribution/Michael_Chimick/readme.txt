The game design files I completed entirely on my own, Alex Dellow and Jonathan Chu were in the group,
but they only helped in discussing the really high level draft, and never wrote anything down; they were purely vocal.

The game engine file took me about a week to finally figure out, but was never used.
I was assigned to figure out google test by Marc Vouve, but afterwards he always told me to go away
whenever I asked for the next task. Eventually I told Calvin that Marc wasn't giving me any tasks and he gave me things to do.

The no team files are what I was assigned to do directly from Calvin.
